R code implementing Stage 1 of the integrative covariate-balancing weighting strategy developed in Guha and Li (2024): "Causal Meta-Analysis by Integrating Multiple Observational Studies with Multivariate Outcomes," recently accepted for publication in the journal "Biometrics". 

To run the code, open the R project and execute the command “main.R.” The code reads in an example dataset and implements the FLEXOR, IGO, and IC weighting methods.
